<p>On Saturday, 21st June 2025, members and friends of the Kenyan Community in Scotland came together for a stunning summer hike in the Glenshee region, conquering two magnificent Munros: Glas Tulaichean (1,051 m / 3,448 ft) and Càrn an Rìgh (1,029 m / 3,376 ft).</p>

<p>We departed Edinburgh at 6:00 AM, having assembled at Usher Hall with excitement and anticipation. After arriving around 8:00 AM at the <strong>Dalmunzie Hotel</strong> near Spittal of Glenshee, we began our 19 km circular hike under gradually clearing skies. The trail offered a mixture of gentle climbs and steeper sections through glens and ridges, revealing breathtaking Highland vistas.</p>
