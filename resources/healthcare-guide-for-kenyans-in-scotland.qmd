## 🏥 Your Health, Your Right

Healthcare in Scotland is **free at the point of use** through the **NHS (National Health Service)** - as long as you've paid the **Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)** as part of your visa application. This guide helps you navigate NHS Scotland services, register with a doctor, and know what to do in case of emergencies.

## 🧭 1. NHS Scotland Basics

- **NHS Scotland** provides healthcare to all residents, including international newcomers who have paid the **IHS**.
- You don’t pay for hospital care or GP visits.
- You may pay a small charge for prescriptions or dental treatment.
- Services are based on clinical need — not your immigration status, as long as you're eligible.
