## ðŸŒ„ The Day Unfolded

We departed Edinburgh at 6:00 AM, having assembled at Usher Hall with excitement and anticipation. After arriving around 8:00 AM at the **Dalmunzie Hotel** near Spittal of Glenshee, we began our 19 km circular hike under gradually clearing skies. The trail offered a mixture of gentle climbs and steeper sections through glens and ridges, revealing breathtaking Highland vistas.
