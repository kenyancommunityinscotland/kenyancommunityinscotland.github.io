On Saturday, 19th July 2025, members and friends of the Kenyan Community in Scotland came together for a monumental hike up **Ben Nevis** (1,345 m / 4,413 ft), the highest mountain in the British Isles. Our journey began at Glen Nevis, following a well-established trail to the summit.

## 🏔️ The Ascent Begins

We left Edinburgh bright and early at 5:00 AM, gathering at Usher Hall with backpacks, snacks, and anticipation. Arriving at **Glen Nevis Visitor Centre** by 9:00 AM, we began our steady ascent under mild summer skies.

The trail welcomed us with sweeping valley views, laughter, and shared excitement.
